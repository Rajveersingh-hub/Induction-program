## üßë‚Äçüéì Day-1

### 1. Gurudwara Sahib Visit (8:30 AM ‚Äì 9:30 AM)
The program began with a spiritual start at the College Gurudwara Sahib. The environment was peaceful and calming. It helped me feel mentally prepared for this new phase of life. It was a great way to begin our journey at GNDEC with blessings and positive energy.

### 2. Auditorium Session (10:00 AM ‚Äì 1:00 PM)
The main event was held in the college auditorium. It was very informative and inspiring.  

- The **Head of the Department of Applied Science** gave a warm welcome and explained how the foundation courses are important for engineering.
- The **Principal Sir** motivated us with his speech about discipline, dedication, and using our college years wisely. He emphasized how GNDEC has a legacy of excellence.
- The **HOD of IT Department** introduced the department and told us about the opportunities, projects, and support systems available. It made me feel excited about the next four years.

### Overall Experience
The induction made me feel like I made the right choice by joining GNDEC. The speeches gave a clear idea of what to expect and how to make the most out of this journey. I also got to see my batchmates and felt proud to be a part of the GNDEC family.
